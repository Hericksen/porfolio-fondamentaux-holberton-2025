## Team Formation Overview

From the outset, Guillaume and I discovered a shared vision and complementary strengths, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment. Our mutual enthusiasm for blending fitness with gamification set the tone for our project.

- **Gwendal Martin** focused on organizational structure and documentation, ensuring clear communication and progress tracking.  
- **Guillaume Bouvier** brought analytical prowess and technical insights, driving the brainstorming and evaluation processes.

We established regular meetings and utilized tools like **Google Docs** and **Discord** to maintain seamless communication and collaboration.

---

## Research and Brainstorming

Our ideation process was enriched by employing the **SCAMPER technique** and **Mind Mapping**, which allowed us to explore various dimensions of potential ideas.

### SCAMPER Application:

- **Substitute**: Replacing traditional workout tracking with RPG-style quests.  
- **Combine**: Merging fitness routines with gaming elements to enhance user engagement.  
- **Adapt**: Tailoring gaming mechanics to suit fitness goals and user preferences.  
- **Modify**: Adjusting difficulty levels to cater to different fitness levels.  
- **Put to another use**: Utilizing game progression systems to motivate physical activity.  
- **Eliminate**: Removing monotonous workout logs in favor of interactive challenges.  
- **Reverse**: Shifting the perspective from fitness as a chore to an adventurous journey.

### Mind Mapping:

We created a central node labeled **“Gamified Fitness App”** and branched out into categories such as:
- User Engagement  
- Technical Feasibility  
- Market Trends  
- Potential Challenges  

This visual representation helped us identify connections and prioritize features.

- **Achievements**: Badges and milestones to recognize user progress  
- **Avatar Customization**: Personalization options unlocked through consistent activity

---

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Challenges:
- Ensuring the game elements enhance rather than distract from fitness goals  
- Maintaining user engagement over time

### Opportunities:
- Potential for community features to foster social interaction  
- Expansion into different fitness levels and goals

---

## Mobile Export Challenges

During development, we encountered difficulties exporting the application to mobile platforms, particularly regarding:
- Performance optimization  
- User interface scalability

### Request for Insights:

We would greatly appreciate any **advice or strategies from Kevin Pelissard** on effectively exporting web applications to mobile platforms, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

---

## Conclusion

Our collaborative efforts have led to the development of a **promising MVP** that merges fitness and gaming to promote a healthier lifestyle. We are committed to refining this concept and overcoming technical challenges to deliver an engaging and effective application.

## Project Purpose and Objectives

### Purpose:
In today’s digital world, maintaining a regular fitness routine is a challenge for many, often due to a lack of motivation, routine fatigue, or the absence of immediate, satisfying rewards. Our project addresses this by blending physical activity with the engaging elements of RPG (Role-Playing Game) mechanics, creating a gamified experience that makes fitness more fun, immersive, and sustainable. The idea is to shift fitness from being a chore to becoming a daily adventure. Through this MVP, we aim to encourage healthier habits, promote regular movement, and keep users committed over the long term by offering them meaningful, game-like progression tied to real-world exercise.

### Objectives:

- Transform fitness into an interactive game by building an MVP that uses daily and weekly physical challenges as quests, awarding experience points (XP), levels, and achievements to keep users engaged and motivated.
- Foster personal investment in health goals through an avatar system that evolves based on the user’s real-world activity, helping users visualize their progress in a fun, personalized way.
- Lay the groundwork for future scalability by ensuring that the MVP’s architecture and user experience are designed for easy expansion into features such as social competition, team quests, and cross-platform use across web and mobile.
